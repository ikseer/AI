Project Name: Jarvis - AI Chatbot with Summarization and Public Safety Focus

Description:

This Python script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to create a conversational AI chatbot named Jarvis. It allows users to interact with Jarvis by providing prompts or questions. Jarvis then generates responses using GPT-3's powerful language processing capabilities.

Key Features:

Conversational Interface: Users can interact with Jarvis through a command-line interface, providing prompts and questions like they would in a natural conversation.
Summarization: Jarvis is instructed to incorporate summary generation into its responses, making them more concise and informative.
Public Safety Focus: While not explicitly implemented in the code, the prompt construction ("write summary and clear answer for public people") suggests a potential focus on providing accurate and responsible information for the general public.
Installation:

Create an OpenAI Account and API Key:

Visit https://openai.com/ to create an account and obtain an API key.
Store your API key securely (not in the code itself).
Install Dependencies:

Bash
pip install openai
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Replace Placeholder API Key:

Open the script (main.py) and replace 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 with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the Script:

Bash
python main.py
Use code with caution.

Interact with Jarvis:

Type your prompts or questions at the You: prompt.
Jarvis will respond with a generated answer, incorporating summarization as instructed in the prompt.
Type quit, exit, bye, or ciao to exit the conversation.
Example:

You: What is the capital of France?
Jarvis: The capital of France is Paris. (Summary)
You: Can you tell me more about the history of Paris?
Jarvis: Paris has a rich and long history dating back to the 3rd century BC. It has been a major center of power, culture, and commerce throughout its history. (Summary)
You: How do I get to Paris from Cairo?
Jarvis: Here are some options to get to Paris from your current location, considering various travel methods and their estimated times and costs. (This functionality would require additional implementation.)
You: quit
Disclaimer:

This script is a basic example and may require further development to ensure responsible and accurate response generation, especially for sensitive topics. It's crucial to carefully consider the potential biases and limitations of large language models like GPT-3.
